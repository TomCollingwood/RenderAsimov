# RenderAsimov
Renderman RIB assignment for Rendering, SDAGE 2nd year

I used Ian Stephenson's doDisplace.sl "old-school" shader for my randomDisk.osl shader. The randomDisk.osl shader itself is based on Ian Stephenson's also. The source is mentioned in the pdf.

To render the book simply call "make" in terminal while inside the extracted directory. Renderman 20 installation required.

Inside RIB/main.rib and the Makefile are some commented code which you uncomment to get the second render. You also comment the first render equivalents to get second render.

I have included an animate.sh script that renders lots of frames of the book rotating, to see an in-progress video visit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4hN0T_ml58 (60fps 720p). All the scripts need to be changed to wherever the directory is located in your own computer if you want to use them.

Enjoy! I still haven't read the book yet, I will do so this Christmas.
